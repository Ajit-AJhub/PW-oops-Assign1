    "Q2. Name the four pillars of OOPs.\n",
    "Ans2- \n",
    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the methods/functions that operate on that data into a single unit called an object. \n",
    "It hides the internal details of an object and provides a well-defined interface to interact with the object. \n",
    "Encapsulation helps in achieving data security and code modularity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class to inherit properties and behaviors from another class, \n",
    "called the superclass or base class. The class that inherits these properties and behaviors is called the subclass or derived class.\n",
    "Inheritance promotes code reusability and allows the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on different forms or have multiple behaviors depending on the context.\n",
    "In OOP, polymorphism is typically achieved through method overriding and method overloading. \n",
    "Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass.\n",
    "Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameters to exist in a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction involves focusing on essential qualities while ignoring unnecessary details.\n",
    "It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces that define a common set of methods and properties that subclasses can implement in \n",
    "their own way. Abstraction helps in managing complexity by providing a high-level view of the system and hiding the internal implementation details.\n",
    "It also enables the separation of interface and implementation, \n",
    "allowing changes in the implementation without affecting the clients of the interface."
